This is a RESTful API for managing a movie library built using Laravel. The API supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for movies, adhering to RESTful API design best practices. The API also includes features like data validation, exception handling, pagination, and filtering.

## Features

- **Validation**: Ensures that all inputs are validated before processing.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful error messages.
- **Pagination**: Supports pagination for movie listings to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Filtering**: Allows filtering movies based on specific criteria (e.g., genre, release year).
- **Sorting**: Supports sorting movies by different attributes (e.g., title, rating).
